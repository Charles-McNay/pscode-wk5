// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

1. Start

2. Read the first number (num1)

3. Read the second number (num2)

4. Set sum variable 0

5. Add num1 and num2 and store the result in the sum variable

6. Display sum

7. End


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

1. Read the number to be checked.
2. Divide the number by 2 and check the remainder.
3. If the remainder is 0, the number is even.
4. If the remainder is 1, the number is odd.
5. Print the result indicating whether the number is odd or even.

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

1. Read in the numbers 2, 4, 6, 7, 9 into a list or array.
2. Initialize a variable called sum to 0.
3. Initialize variables called minimum and maximum to the first number in the list.
4. Iterate through each number in the list:
     - Add the current number to the sum.
     - If the current number is smaller than the minimum, update the minimum.
     - If the current number is larger than the maximum, update the maximum.
5. Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the list.
6. Print out the average with a message, e.g., "The average is: <average>".
7. Print out the minimum and maximum with messages, e.g., "The smallest number is: <minimum>" and "The largest number is: <maximum>".
